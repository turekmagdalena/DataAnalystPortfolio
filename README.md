# DataAnalystPortfolio

This portfolio showcases projects developed using Python and SQL. I sourced or scraped the required data myself and identified problems that their analysis could solve.

Additionally, it includes two projects (prefixed with Studies_) created as a part of my postgraduate studies in Machine Learning & Data Science to meet academic requirements.
