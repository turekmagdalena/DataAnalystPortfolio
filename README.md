# DataAnalystPortfolio

Hello! I'm Magda, an aspiring Data Analyst with nearly 7 years of experience as a Robotic Process Automation Developer. Upon completing my postgraduate studies in Machine Learning & Data Science, I decided to transition into working with Data. I've dedicated considerable time to perfecting my Python and SQL coding skills through books, online courses, and coding challenges like DataWars, HackerRank etc.

This portfolio showcases the projects I developed using Python and SQL. I sourced or scraped the required data myself and identified problems that their analysis could solve. I hope it demonstrates what I've learned so far.

Additionally, it includes two projects (prefixed with Studies_) created as a part of my postgraduate studies to meet academic requirements.
