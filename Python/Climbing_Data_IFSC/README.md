For this project I decided to analyze the data that aligns with my interests, which is climbing. I scraped the athletes and events data from International Climbing Federation website in order to answer the following questions:
- Which country has the most climbers participating in championships - considering number and ratio of population?
- How often climbers are in top 3 when competition is held in their own country?
- Does being experienced in competitions help with achieving higher rank?
