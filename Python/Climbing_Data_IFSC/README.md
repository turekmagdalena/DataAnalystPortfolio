For this project, I decided to analyze the data that aligns with my interests, which is climbing. I scraped the athletes and events data from International Climbing Federation website in order to answer the following questions:
- Which country has the most climbers participating in championships - considering number and ratio of population?
- How often climbers are in top 3 when competition is held in their own country?
- Does being experienced in competitions help with achieving higher rank?
  
Additionally, IOC codes were scraped from Wikipedia, and world population data was sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazidthe1/world-population-data

I demonstrated the following advanced Python skills:
- data scraping using Selenium
- data preprocessing
- groupby
- merge
- visualization (pie, bar, scatter plot)
- RegEx
- correlation
etc.

The project was prepared using Google Colab notebook.
